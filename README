usage: retry [-d duration]  [-i interval] -- command [args ...]
Retry command for specified duration at specified interval

  -d  length of time to retry command, in seconds
  -i  delay between attempts

Examples:
  Retry command "true" for 1 hour, every 60 seconds, or until success:
  # retry -- true

  Retry command "false" for 10 seconds, every 2 seconds, or until
  success.  Send email on failure.
  # retry -d 10 -i 2 -- false || mutt -s "false failed all attempts" \
    lclark@2bdx.net </dev/null

  The following represents alternate methods to wait for a file.  The
  retry version differs in that it times out.
  # while [ ! -f $file ]; do sleep 1; done

  # retry -i 1 -d 30 -- [ -f $file ] || echo "File not found"
